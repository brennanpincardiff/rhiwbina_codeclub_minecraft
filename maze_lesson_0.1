Let's try to write a maze lesson for a one hour Code Club lesson. 

Aim: Download file with a maze in it; run the file  

**Steps:**
1. Assemble the Pi.
2. Connect to the internet
3. Download the file with the maze in it...
4. Type this code into the new file
```python
from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft

mc = Minecraft.create()

# open file 
filename = "maze.txt"
file = open(filename, "r")
# use file to draw maze
# put setBlocks command in file?
setBlocks(x0,y0,z0,x1,y1,z1,blockType, blockData)

# teleport player to door





```
6. Save the file with a meaningful name... `maze`.
7. Go to Terminal.
8. Check that you're in the directory where you saved the file.
9. To run the file, type `python maze.py` in the Terminal and press return.
10. Go to Minecraft and see if your maze has been made...


11. Try changing the size or what the building is made of...
12. Change your script, save it, run again in Terminal and check in Minecraft.
13. Change and repeat - have fun :smiley:
