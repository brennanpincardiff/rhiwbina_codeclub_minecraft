Let's try to write a maze lesson for a one hour Code Club lesson. 

Aim: Download file with a maze in it; run the file  

**Steps:**
1. Assemble the Pi.
2. Connect to the internet
3. Download the file with the maze in it...


4. Type this code into the new file

```python
from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft
mc = Minecraft.create()
import mcpi.block as block

GAP = block.AIR.id
WALL = block.GOLD_BLOCK.id
FLOOR = block.grass.id

FILENAME = "maze1.csv"
f = open(FILENAME, "r")

pos = mc.player.getTilePos()
ORIGIN_X = pos.x+1
ORIGIN_Y = pos.y
ORIGIN_Z = pos.z+1

z = ORIGIN_Z

for line in f.readlines():
    data = line.split(",")
    x = ORIGIN_X
    for cell in data:
        if cell == "0":
            b = GAP
        else:
            b = WALL
        mc.setBlock(x, ORIGIN_Y, z, b)
        mc.setBlock(x, ORIGIN_Y+1, z, b)
        mc.setBlock(x, ORIGIN_Y-1, z, FLOOR)
        x = x + 1
    z = z + 1
```

6. Save the file with a meaningful name... `maze`.
7. Go to Terminal.
8. Check that you're in the directory where you saved the file.
9. To run the file, type `python maze.py` in the Terminal and press return.
10. Go to Minecraft and see if your maze has been made...


11. Try changing the size or what the building is made of...
12. Change your script, save it, run again in Terminal and check in Minecraft.
13. Change and repeat - have fun :smiley:

**Types of block that you might like to try**

| Number        | Block| 
| :-------------: |:-------------:| 
| 17 | WOOD     | 
| 35 | WOOL     | 
| 79 | ICE      | 

See documentation for a full list of block types: (http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/p/minecraft-api-reference.html)
