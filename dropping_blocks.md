Building on [Getting Started with Minecraft Pi](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-minecraft-pi)

Aim: To get learners moving with manipulating Minecraft Pi with Python as soon as possible. 

**Steps:**
1. Assemble the Pi.
2. Open Minecraft and create a new world.
3. Open the Python3 IDE
4. Open a new file
5. Cut and paste this code into the new file
```python
from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft
from time import sleep

mc = Minecraft.create()

flower = 38

while True:
    x, y, z = mc.player.getPos()
    mc.setBlock(x, y, z, flower)
    sleep(0.1)
```
6. Save the file with a meaningful name... `drop_block`
7. Go to Terminal
8. Check that you're in the directory where you saved the file
9. To run the file, type `python drop_block.py` in the Terminal 
10. Go to Minecraft and move about and see if you're dropping flowers..
11. Try flying through the air and see the flowers you leave in the sky
12. To stop your Python script - either press `Ctrl c` or you need to open another Terminal and type `killall python` 
13. How about you go back to your Python script and change the types of block that you drop
14. Replace the word `flower` with one of numbers below 
15. Change your script, save it, run again in Terminal and check in Minecraft
16. Change and repeat. 

**Types of block that you might like to try**

| Number        | Block| 
| :-------------: |:-------------:| 
| 1     | STONE | 
| 2      | GRASS    | 
| 6 | SAPLING      | 
| 9 | FLOWING WATER      | 
| 10 | LAVA_FLOWING      |
